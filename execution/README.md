# Execution

Layer 3: Doing the work

This directory contains deterministic Python scripts that handle:

- API calls
- Data processing
- File operations
- Database interactions

Scripts should be:
- Reliable and testable
- Well-commented
- Fast
- Use environment variables from `.env` for secrets

Check existing scripts before creating new ones.
