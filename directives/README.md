# Directives

Layer 1: What to do

This directory contains SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) written in Markdown. Each directive should define:

- **Goals** - What the directive accomplishes
- **Inputs** - What data/information is needed
- **Tools/Scripts** - Which execution scripts to use
- **Outputs** - What the directive produces
- **Edge Cases** - Known limitations or special handling

Write directives like you would give instructions to a mid-level employee.
