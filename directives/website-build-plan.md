# MortAi Website Build Plan

## Executive Summary

A premium dark-mode website for MortAi, an **AI-Powered Lead Generation** agency. The site features a scroll-driven 3D funnel animation and strategic copy placement designed to convert visitors into $50 audit bookings, then upsell to higher tiers.

**Positioning:** AI-Powered Lead Generation (covers both email outreach and ad creative arms)

**Launch Strategy:** Founding client pricing to build case studies, then raise prices with proof.

---

## Part 1: Service Tier Strategy

### Positioning

**Don't call it "cold email"** — that's commoditized and associated with spam.

**MortAi does:** AI-Powered Lead Generation
- Email arm: Problem-aware prospecting using review data
- Ads arm: Luxury video creative + campaign management

This positioning covers both services under one umbrella.

### Two Parallel Tracks + Bundle

| Track | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| **Track A** | AI Outreach (email sequences, review-based enrichment) |
| **Track B** | Luxury Ad Creative (video production + management) |
| **Bundle** | Full Growth Accelerator (both tracks) |

### Pricing Strategy: Founding Client → Standard

**Phase 1 (Now):** Lower "founding client" rates to get 3-5 case studies
**Phase 2 (With proof):** Raise to standard rates, update site with real stats

### Founding Client Pricing (Launch)

| Tier | Service | Founding Price | Standard Price (Later) |
|------|---------|----------------|------------------------|
| **1** | Business Audit | $50 | $50 |
| **2A** | AI Outreach - Foundation | $1,500-2,000/mo + $200/meeting | $2,500/mo |
| **2B** | Ad Creative - Starter | $2,000/mo + ad spend | $3,000/mo |
| **3A** | AI Outreach - Scale | $3,500/mo + $250/meeting | $5,500/mo |
| **3B** | Ad Creative - Premium | $4,500/mo + 15% ad spend | $6,500/mo |

|---|---------|---------|-----------------|
| 1 | **Hero** | Capture attention, state value prop | 0-15% |
| 2 | **Social Proof Strip** | Instant credibility | 15-20% |

| 20-40% | Starts sinking down | Flow accelerates |
| 40-60% | Half-visible, particles exit bottom | Continuous stream |
| 60-80% | Mostly hidden behind content | Particles disperse |
| 80-100% | Gone, only occasional particles float | Ambient particles |

---

## Part 3: Copy Strategy

### Hero Section

**Headline formula:** Outcome + Differentiator

**Recommended:**
> "Turn Cold Leads Into Booked Calls — Without Hiring More SDRs"

**Subhead:**
> "AI-powered outreach that finds, contacts, and books your ideal customers while you focus on closing."

**CTAs:**
- Primary: "Book Your $50 Audit"
- Secondary: "See How It Works"

**Trust strip (immediately below):**
- "Trusted by X businesses" or client logos
- Can use "AI-Powered • Done-For-You • Results Guaranteed" badges initially

---

### Problem Section

**Purpose:** Make them feel understood before pitching

**Copy direction:**
> "Your sales team is drowning in manual prospecting. They're spending hours finding leads, writing emails, and following up — instead of actually selling."

**Pain points to hit:**
- Manual prospecting eats 60% of sales time
- Generic outreach gets ignored
- Hiring SDRs is expensive and slow
- You're leaving money on the table

---

### Solution Section

**3-4 core benefits with icons:**

1. **AI-Powered Lead Research**
   > We scrape and enrich leads based on the specific problems your solution solves — pulled from real reviews and data.

2. **Personalized Outreach at Scale**
   > Every email reads like it was written for that one person. Because our AI actually researches them first.

3. **Automated Follow-Up Sequences**
   > Persistent, never annoying. We follow up until they book or opt out.

4. **Luxury Creative That Converts** (Tristan's arm)
   > Video ads that make your brand look like the premium choice it is.

---

### How It Works

**3-step simplification:**

1. **Audit** → We analyze your ICP, market, and current outreach
2. **Build** → We create your AI-powered lead gen machine
3. **Scale** → You get qualified meetings while we optimize

**Visual:** This maps to the funnel animation — leads enter top, qualified meetings come out bottom.

---

### Services Section

**Display as cards:**
- Show Tier 1 (Audit) prominently as entry point
- Show Track A (Email) and Track B (Ads) as two paths
- "Need both?" → Full Growth Accelerator bundle

**Card hover:** Teal glow effect

---

### Results/Social Proof

**Launch approach (no case studies yet):**

Since you don't have client results yet, focus on:

1. **Industry benchmarks** (clearly framed):
   > "Companies using AI-driven outreach report 2-3x higher reply rates than template-based campaigns."

2. **Methodology proof** — explain WHY your approach works:
   > "We don't guess what to say. We analyze reviews to find the exact language your prospects use to describe their problems — then mirror it back to them."

3. **Credibility signals:**
   - Tools you use (Instantly, AI enrichment)
   - Your own business results (run your campaign first)
   - "Founding client" transparency

**Placeholder spots:** Build the section with easy-to-update areas for real stats once you have them.

**After 3-5 clients:** Replace with actual metrics and testimonials.

---

### FAQ Section (Objection Handling)

| Objection | FAQ Question | Answer Direction |
|-----------|--------------|------------------|
| "Is this spam?" | "Will my emails get flagged as spam?" | Explain deliverability infrastructure, domain warming, personalization |
| "What if it doesn't work?" | "What results can I expect?" | Set realistic expectations, mention optimization period |
| "Is it worth the cost?" | "How does pricing work?" | ROI framing: cost per meeting vs hiring SDRs |
| "How is this different?" | "What makes MortAi different from other agencies?" | AI + human strategy, personalization from reviews, luxury creative arm |
| "How long to see results?" | "When will I start getting meetings?" | Typically 2-4 weeks for first appointments after warmup |

---

### Final CTA Section

**Headline:**
> "Ready to Fill Your Pipeline?"

**Subhead:**
> "Start with a $50 audit. We'll show you exactly how AI can transform your outreach — and credit it toward any package."

**CTA Button:** "Book Your Audit"

**Scarcity (premium, not pushy):**
> "We take on 8 new clients per quarter to ensure results."
